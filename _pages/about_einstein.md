Hi there!  I am a PhD candidate at [HKU](https://hku.hk/), working with Professor [Chao Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Zkv9FqwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and a member of the [Data Intelligence Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/chaoh). I previously interned at Baidu, working under the leadership of [Dawei Yin](https://www.yindawei.com/). My research interests include large language models, multi-modal learning, retrieval-augmented generation, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs.
